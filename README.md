# Classification-of-seeds-MLA
Binary classification of seeds according to their Geometrical properties .

About :
Classification of seeds into different categories is much necessary with respect to the
farmer's perspective.classifying seeds on the basis of their physical parameters will help
farmers a lot in planning their sale.Bigger seeds have different uses and so thus the
smaller one.The classifier we used is logistic regression,which will classify the seeds
into two categories accordingly. We will be using various libraries for data visualisation
and model fit as well.
